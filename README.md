# Multi Label Classifcation using keras Deep Neural Networks <br>

This code is written as support to this article on Medium

Topics
* Keras Neural Networks
* Multi Label Classification 
* Metric = 'accuracy'
* Model Evaluation using Custom Metric <br>

Packages Used: 
* keras
* numpy
* pandas <br>

The purpose of this code is to show how one can build a basic Multi Label Classification Neural Network using Keras.
This code also helps one understand what to look out for when using 'accuracy' as a metric for model evaluation in multi label classification problems with high target dimensionality and sparse data.
